## Candidate listing copy

### Store name

Better GitHub Stars Manager

### Short description

Organize GitHub stars with search, tags, notes, filters, and optional Gist sync.

### Detailed description

Better GitHub Stars Manager upgrades GitHub's native stars page into a fast, local-first workspace for heavy stars users.

Use it to:

- load and browse large star collections in a virtualized table
- search across repository name, description, topics, and your own notes
- organize repos with custom tags and notes
- filter by language, tags, and untagged items
- sync only your annotation layer across devices through your own secret GitHub Gist

The extension works only on GitHub and uses GitHub's own APIs. It does not require a separate account or a custom backend.

## Suggested store category

Developer Tools

## Suggested screenshots

Chrome Web Store screenshots must be `1280x800` or `640x400` pixels.

Prepared store screenshots:

- `public/store/screenshots/screenshot-main-stars.png`
- `public/store/screenshots/screenshot-options.png`
- `public/store/screenshots/screenshot-detail-panel.png`

The token tutorial images remain useful for README and onboarding, but they are not the primary store screenshots:

- `public/tutorial/img_01.png`
- `public/tutorial/img_02.png`
- `public/tutorial/img_03.png`

## Promotional images

Chrome Web Store requires one small promotional image at `440x280`.

Prepared promo assets derived from `public/poster/img.png`:

- `public/store/promo/small-tile.png` (`440x280`)
- `public/store/promo/marquee.png` (`1400x560`)

## Permission justification

### `storage`

Used to store local configuration, encrypted token material, query state, and annotation data needed by the extension UI.

### `https://github.com/*`

Used to mount the manager UI on GitHub stars pages and repository pages where the repo tag chip appears.
The match pattern is broad because MV3 match patterns cannot target query strings such as `?tab=stars`, so the content script matches GitHub pages and then gates at runtime.

### `https://api.github.com/*`

Used to authenticate the provided token, fetch the authenticated user's starred repositories, and optionally sync annotations through the user's own secret GitHub Gist.

## Privacy practices form notes

When filling the Chrome Web Store privacy section, the current codebase supports these answers:

- User data is used only to provide the extension's core functionality.
- Data is not sold.
- Data is not used for personalized advertising.
- Data is not used for creditworthiness or lending purposes.
- Data is not shared with third-party analytics or ad SDKs.
- Remote services contacted by the extension are limited to GitHub and the GitHub API.
- The extension stores star metadata locally and optionally stores user-created annotations in the user's own secret GitHub Gist.

If the dashboard asks for a Limited Use statement, reuse the language from `docs/privacy-policy.md`.

## Reviewer test instructions

1. Open the extension Options page.
2. Paste a GitHub fine-grained personal access token.
3. Grant `Public repositories` repository access.
4. Add `Starring: Read-only` and `Gists: Read and write` for full-feature testing.
5. Save the token and confirm the extension shows the authenticated account.
6. Open `https://github.com/{your-username}?tab=stars`.
7. Click `Sync` to import stars into the local database.
8. Verify that repositories appear, search works, and notes or tags can be added.
9. Click `Push` to create or update the dedicated secret sync Gist, then click `Pull` to fetch it back.
